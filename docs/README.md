# Two-Factor Authentication

The two-factor authentication modules allows users to select additional checking on log in by random generated code that may be sent by selected driver like E-mail.

Available drivers:

- E-mail
- Google Authenticator

Some user groups may be enforced to always use 2FA.

Group "Administrator" is enforced by default.

Length of verifying code can be defined in the module configuration. Default is 6.
